# Dinosaur Island Language Model

This repository contains an implementation of a character-level language model for generating dinosaur names. The model is trained on a dataset of over 19,000 dinosaur names.

## Approach

The model is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a single hidden layer of 128 units. The RNN is trained using the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function.

## Results

The model is capable of generating realistic and creative dinosaur names. Here are a few examples:

- Trodonosaurus
- Eiacosaurus
- Llecagosaurus

## Usage

To use the model, simply generate a random seed character and feed it to the model. The model will then generate a sequence of characters until it reaches a stop character.

You can use the model to generate dinosaur names for various purposes, such as for creating video game characters, writing stories, or simply for fun.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with generating your own unique dinosaur names!
